> An rc file for rc files.

Does your project contain too many _unnecessary_ .dotfiles that clutter up your repository? Masterrc removes this clutter by creating a master rc file that automatically builds all of them for you.


## Usage
(1) Download masterrc from npm and make the command line tool available globally.
```bash
$ npm install -g masterrc && npm link
```
(2) Open your project folder and create a `.masterrc` file using the format described in the template.
```bash
$ cd yourDirectory/yourRepository
$ touch .masterrc
```
(3) Generate your .dotfiles
```bash
$ masterrc
```
